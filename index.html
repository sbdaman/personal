<h3><a id="meeting-one" class="anchor" href="#meeting-one" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meeting One Recap </br> <small> April 28th, 2015 </small> </h3>

<p>

This will be the general format for a meeting recap. I will livetweet during the meeting, and after the meeting is finished I will post a summary of the meeting with tweets embedded for reference. For example, assume I was talking about the Peel School Board strike. I would explain what was going on with a summary, add context with a tweet and then continue writing after it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Peel School Board says there is no update yet on whether high school teachers will be on strike Monday.</p>&mdash; CP24 (@CP24) <a href="https://twitter.com/CP24/status/595077038035308546">May 4, 2015</a></blockquote>

</br>

I did not live tweet the first meeting but I will provide a recap. If you want to read a summary that <i>contains tweets</i> then head over to <a href="https://storify.com/WarnerYYZ/utsu-transition-meeting-april-28">Steve Warner's storyify </a> of the first meeting. Steve is one of the Victoria College directors and the person who inspired this idea. He begins his summary with the last meeting of the outgoing board and then goes through the first meeting of the incoming (the one that I'm apart of) board. I will provide <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d6cnq3g0zuk6d5g/FIRST%20MEETING%20-%202015.04-APRIL%20BOARD%20PACKAGE-FINAL.pdf?dl=0">the agenda</a> for each meeting within the summary.

</br>
</br>

The first meeting began around the time it was supposed to end. The old board's final meeting was scheduled to run from 4:00PM to 6:00PM but ended up running significantly late. The new board's first meeting was scheduled to begin at 6 but didn't begin until roughly 7:45PM. This was the result of a combination of factors, namely the old board meeting going significantly over time. UTSU has a track recording of issues with quorum and getting meetings started on time, but I think as far as this meeting goes it was excusable. Besides, we met quorum on the first count (albeit the count was over an hour and a half late) so that is an accomplishment in and of itself. 

</br>
</br>

The first item on the Agenda was the approval of the chair for the 2015-2016 year. In the past, Ashkon Hashemi has been ratified the chair at the first meeting of each year. He has been the speaker for the UTSU since 2008 and most likely earlier, I just haven't checked. Instead of ratifying Ashkon this year, there is an application open for the speaker position in which anyone who feels qualified can apply (Ashkon can apply too). By default, since there was no chair ratified, Ben Coleman, the president, chaired the meeting until we could ratify a speaker. We temporarily ratified an old New College council speaker (at the recommendation of Ben Coleman) until we could hire a full time speaker for the rest of the year.

</br>
</br>

The next two items were the approval of the agenda and the opening remarks, both of which we got through quickly. Following that, the next item on the agenda was the appointment of a Vice President Campus Life. This was the most <i>interesting</i> part of the night and took up the majority of the meeting. The Vice President Campus Life is an appointed, executive, voting (more on this later) member of the union. As per the policy, the VP CL is responsible for orientation and other events that aid the student life of the university. The outgoing VP CL was Zijian Yang. 

</br>
</br>

Vice President Campus Life hiring is done through an executive hiring committee. The committee is made up of various executive members. </br> 
<ul>
<li>Outgoing and Incoming Presidents</li>
<li>Vice-President Internal and Services</li>
<li>Outgoing Vice-President Campus Life</li>
<li>One (1) additional member of the Executive</li>
<li>Executive Director (non-voting)</li>
</ul>

The hiring process consists of an application process, followed by interviews by the hiring committee and ends with the remaining candidates presenting in front of the board. The hiring committee must present <b> at least two </b> applicants to the board, and the board will decide to appoint one or to reopen nominations. At the meeting, we were given two options, a St. Mikes student named Terri (never really got their names so I might be spelling this wrong) and another student named Akshan. After the two presentations, the board went into camera to make their decision. After roughly an hour of discussion, we exited camera. 

</br>
</br>

Once we exited camera, I moved a motion to table the selection of the Vice President Campus Life position indefinitely. As a result of the restrictions placed by being in camera, I am very limited about what I can say here, but I started the motion with the intent of having as open and fair procedure as possible. <b> The motion passed 14 - 13 with 2 abstentions. </b> This was then followed by another motion that urged the executive hiring committee to present more than two candidates for the VP CL position to the board, this also passed. 

</br>
</br>

Once the two motions passed, we moved onto the next agenda item without hiring a VP Campus Life. The next item was a budget and the VP Internal, Ryan Gomes, presented some changes. Both the changes and the budget were passed after some brief discussion. The following item was the ratification of the new signing authorities; this simply replaced the signing authorities with the newly elected president and vice president internal. This passed.

</br>
</br>

After all of this was settled, it was around 11:00. Due to the time, the board adjourned the meeting. There will be an emergency meeting on Thursday, May 7th to deal with the VP CL hiring issues. I will post another update then. Hopefully, with live tweeting, future updates will not be as long.
